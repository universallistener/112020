        "content": "<p>Long long ago Bhrigu, the son of Varuna deva, once approached his father and said, &ldquo;O father, teach me the Eternal truth&rdquo;. His father explained to him that Food, Prana, Senses, Mind and Speech are the steps to realize the Eternal.&nbsp; He also explained that the Eternal is that truth from which these creatures are born, by which they live, and to which they depart and enter again. He also taught eternal timeless meditation techniques and asked him to meditate and seek the truth.</p><p>Bhrigu followed his father&rsquo;s words and concentrated himself in deep meditation and by the intensity of his contemplation he came to realize that the anna (food or seed or rice) is Eternal. From food alone all these creatures are born, and with food they live, and into food they depart and enter again. This is a very higher truth and he experienced the same how it happens.</p><p>Bhrigu rushed to his father and reported to him about his realization. His father taught him the next level of meditation techniques and exhorted him to go again and meditate more.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhrigu went away and meditated more and more this time, by a little more intense contemplation of this higher meditations, he came to know that Prana or life force is&nbsp;Eternal. He realized that it is because of Prana alone from which these creatures are born and by Prana alone they live and into Prana alone they go hence and return. Bhrigu again rushed to his father expecting that he realized the Eternal. Yet again his father told him to go back with some more advanced techniques and asked him to meditate deeply and realize if there was anything more than Prana. Bhrigu was determined, so he went away to meditate further.</p><p>A little more intense meditation and he had the knowledge that it was Mind which alone was the Eternal. For from Mind alone all creatures are born and by mind they live, and to mind they go hence and return. Bhrigu was happier than before and rushed to his father for the third time. His father listened to him carefully and sent him back to perform more tapas with more higher meditation formats.</p><p>Bhrigu simply followed his father&rsquo;s advice and went again to concentrate. By the power of his contemplation he further came to know that Knowledge is Eternal. For from Knowledge alone all creatures are born, and by Knowledge they live, and to Knowledge they go hence and return. He reported this to his father, but this time as well Varuna repeated the same advice to his son by teaching him the next level meditations.</p><p>Bhrigu was not at all disappointed. He went with more confidence and concentrated deeper than ever before. This time he not only had the experience of the Eternal but <strong>felt one with Him.</strong> He went into complete absorption or Samadhi. He realized that it was Bliss or Ananda that was the Eternal. For from Ananda alone all creatures are born, and by Ananda they live, and to Ananda they go hence and return. He realized his true nature.</p><p>When Varuna came to know about his son&rsquo;s realization he was happy, and this time he greeted Bhrigu as 'Maharshi' with joy and told him, &ldquo;Dear child, this indeed is the highest term of existence. Now there is no need to teach you about the Eternal. You have not only realized this but have identified yourself with That.&rdquo;</p><p>This upanishadic Lore of Bhrigu and Varuna gives courage and strength when you know how the ancient sages have realized the truth.</p><p>Never lose hope and until you reach your goal. You must learn everything in various levels as per the guidance of your master and keep on trying until you finally reach your goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

He had a gurukul where the ancient science of yoga was being taught. One man came to him and asked for a mantra. He said ok you chant ,  Om Namah Shivaya . The man thought what's new in this I already knew this.He did nothing much.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; ><img style= display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  src= https://raw.githubusercontent.com/universallistener/112020/master/y/ys/valueofamantra1.jpg  alt= Value Of A Mantra  /></span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >On the same day one spiritual seeker came to him and said, O sage I bow to you again and again. I surrender myself to you. Please tell me what to do.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >The sage told him,  you stay here and do three things. First look after the cows, second look after the trees , third look after the birds.Exactly after twelve years I will give you one mantra .The man started his service from that moment itself.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >On the same day evening one rich man came to him and asked for help.Please give me one mantra. I have money but much trouble in my life. The Sage told him, 'make a list of all the money you earned in an unethical way by hurting others'. He prepared a list. The sage said leave it here and take one mantra.He did the same.Then sage told him, Come after one year . This man did exactly the same and came after one year. He was very happy, more wealthy than earlier.He was recommended to continue with the same mantra.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >Twelve years passed. The first man did nothing by thinking,'this mantra is a common one and I can do it anytime'.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >The person who was doing selfless service since twelve years, came to the sage and humbly asked for the mantra.He was given the same mantra. Only with a single chant he went into the trance of samadhi. Because he made himself ready with his service and dedication.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >The third man came to the sage and asked,  O Master, what more I can do, please suggest .He was ordered to construct twelve gurukulas with his huge money where the students can stay and plant 500 mango trees. With his selflessness service and practise, one day after three years he also attained a higher level spiritual realization and continued with his practice.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >The value of a mantra depends on your dedication and the price you pay to receive that. Remember the more you pay may be in&nbsp; physical , mental or material ways , you will get the more enhanced and quicker result. Nothing is free in this universe and the universe treats everyone equally.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style= text-align: center; ><span style= font-weight: 400; >||Om||</span></p>",

Then he offered him a place just below the tree where they planned for themselves .Both of them went little away and Sat there.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >Another sage was thinking there must be something wrong. My sage brother got fallen. That's why he is showing very much interest in this woman. At the same time the sage who offered the clothes went into a deep state of meditation.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >Another sage was acting just like he is also doing meditation. But He was thinking,   I know you are thinking about that beautiful lady .He was opening his eyes again and again to check whether he is looking at that woman. Like that with full of thoughts he passed the night.In the morning she came to both of them and asked how and where she can return the clothes.She went in her way.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >Both of them came to the gurukula. Then immediately the other sage came to complain against his fellow sage. Before he can say something , the guru asked can you just go to my room and bring my stick. He went there and saw the same clothes which were given to that lady last night.He could not understand anything.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >The master or the gurudeva said,  It's not the act but it's your mind which never leaves you.I tested both of you. He did his duty thinking the lady as his mother and meditated for the full night.You judged him, you carried that woman in your mind.She is in your mind till now. It was me only. Focus on the purity of your mind , be divine conscious and do your duties selflessly. </span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >These few lines from the Masters mouth brought tremendous changes in the life of that disciple and he became a great sage of his time.</span></p> <p><span style= font-weight: 400; >||Om||</span></p>",
